00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:12.300
so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.040
It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:26.360
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.320
and live out the true meaning of its creed:

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.660
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.520
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.400
the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.220
will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.980
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.340
a state sweltering with the heat of injustice

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.680
sweltering with the heat of oppression

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.780
will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream ...

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.660
that my four little children

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.180
will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.520
by the content of their character.
I have a dream today!

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:58.840
I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists,

00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:05.736
with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of "interposition" and "nullification"

00:02:05.822 --> 00:02:10.062
one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:15.060
will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.500
I have a dream today!

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.760
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.700
and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.504
and the crooked places will be made straight

00:02:36.504 --> 00:02:41.749
"and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together."

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.380
This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.520
With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.280
With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:04.329
into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.784
With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together,

00:03:08.784 --> 00:03:13.806
to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.840
knowing that we will be free one day.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.500
And this will be the day

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.360
this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning:

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.080
My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.780
Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.760
From every mountainside, let freedom ring!

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.400
And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.780
And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.520
Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.280
Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.520
Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.380
Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.200
But not only that

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.280
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.560
Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.900
Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.440
From every mountainside, let freedom ring, and when this happens

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.680
and when we allow freedom ring

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.720
when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.660
from every state and every city

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.400
we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.680
black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.840
will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.800
Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!
